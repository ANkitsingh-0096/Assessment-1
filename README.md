# Problem Statement
Design a system to analyze mobile device usage and user behavior by using a dataset containing user information and device statistics. The project aims to preprocess and clean the data, apply machine learning and clustering techniques, and build models to classify primary use and identify distinct usage patterns. The final application will be an interactive interface deployed with Streamlit, which will include EDA visualizations and model results.
